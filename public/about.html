Currently, I'm pursuing my degree at Mandsaur University, where I'm honing my skills in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by how things work and how technology can be used to improve our everyday lives.
This curiosity led me to the world of engineering, where I found my true calling. Whether it's coding, designing circuits, 
or brainstorming innovative solutions, I love diving deep into the challenges and opportunities that technology presents.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I've worked on several projects that showcase my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world
problems. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, creativity, and perseverance.</p>

which help me stay balanced and inspired.</p>
